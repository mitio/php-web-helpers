# Simple web helpers for PHP

This project contains some simple and very basic helper functions to make your messy PHP code a bit better while developing web pages.

## Usage

To use, just `require_once` in your project the corresponding `helpers/*.php` files you need. If you wish, you could also include `helpers.php` to import all of them in one go.

## Credits

Largely inspired by the great Ruby on Rails framework.
